# ROADMAP

- Add testing DB to mysql container

- Update binary to be able:
* run docker-compose commands via /vendor/bin/stack
* run docker(?) commands via /vendor/bin/stack
* run composer & artisan containers prior docker-compose.yml creation (containers created on the fly, after command is executed - removed)
